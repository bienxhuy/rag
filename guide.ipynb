      "However, there might be a slight ambiguity because option C also explicitly lists Web, Mobile, and AI. Based on the provided information, both A and C would fit, but since the original text uses \"Web, Mobile, and AI,\" it's more accurate to choose A. \n",

Since the user provided the answer choices including A and C, the best match based on the strict reading is A.

      "Wait, the initial part starts with \"It supports...\" listing Apache Cassandra and then continues with more information about other databases. Then comes \"Examples of NewSQL Databases:\" followed by Google Spanner and CockroachDB as examples. So the answer should mention both Apache Cassandra and the two newsql databases provided.
